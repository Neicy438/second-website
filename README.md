# Simple ATM Simulation

This repository contains a **beginner-friendly JavaScript code example** that simulates basic functionalities of an ATM. It's designed to help new programmers understand core programming concepts like variables, objects, functions, and conditional logic in a practical scenario.

## Features

* **User Login:** Authenticate users with a simple account number and PIN.
* **Balance Check:** View the current balance of an account.
* **Deposit Funds:** Add money to an account.
* **Withdraw Funds:** Remove money from an account, with checks for insufficient funds.
* **In-Memory Data:** Account data is stored in a simple JavaScript object for demonstration purposes.

## How to Run

1.  **Save the code:** Copy the entire JavaScript code into a file named `atm_simulation.js` (or `atm_simulation.html` if you prefer to run it directly in a browser with a `<script>` tag).
2.  **Open in Browser (Recommended for Beginners):**
    * If saved as `.html`, simply open the file in any web browser.
    * Right-click anywhere on the page, select "Inspect" (or "Inspect Element"), and navigate to the **"Console"** tab. All the simulation outputs will appear there.
3.  **Using Node.js (For Terminal Execution):**
    * Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system.
    * Open your terminal or command prompt.
    * Navigate to the directory where you saved `atm_simulation.js`.
    * Run the command: `node atm_simulation.js`
    * The output will be displayed directly in your terminal.

## Code Structure

The code is structured into three main sections:

1.  **Data Storage (`accounts` object):** A JavaScript object mimicking a simple database to hold account information (account number, PIN, balance, name). **Note: In a real-world application, this data would be securely stored in a proper database and accessed via a backend server.**
2.  **ATM Functions:**
    * `login(accountNumber, pin)`: Handles user authentication.
    * `checkBalance(account)`: Displays the account's current balance.
    * `deposit(account, amount)`: Processes deposits.
    * `withdraw(account, amount)`: Handles withdrawals with validation.
3.  **Simulation of ATM Usage:** A series of `console.log` statements and function calls demonstrating how the ATM functions would be used in a step-by-step scenario, including successful and failed transactions.

## Important Note

This is a **highly simplified simulation** for educational purposes. A real ATM system would involve:

* **Robust Security:** Encrypted PINs, secure network communication, and advanced fraud prevention.
* **Database Integration:** Persistent and secure storage of vast amounts of transaction and user data.
* **Hardware Interaction:** Interfacing with card readers, cash dispensers, and receipt printers.
* **Error Handling:** Comprehensive handling of various error conditions and edge cases.
* **User Interface:** A graphical user interface (GUI) built with HTML, CSS, and advanced JavaScript frameworks for user interaction.
